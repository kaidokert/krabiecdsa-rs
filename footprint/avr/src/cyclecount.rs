//! Wrap-counted timer for AVR.
//!
//! The ATmega2560 Timer/Counter1 is a 16-bit counter that wraps every 65536
//! ticks. With a prescaler of /1024 at 16 MHz, that's about 4.19 seconds
//! between wraps. Operations that take longer than one wrap (e.g. RSA-1024+
//! verification) lose count without overflow tracking.
//!
//! This module counts overflows in a TIMER1_OVF ISR so the elapsed time
//! returned by [`CycleCounter`] is correct even across many wraps.
